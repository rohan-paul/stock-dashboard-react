### [Live Demo](https://stock-analytics-dashboard.netlify.com/)

#### To run the project in local machine, first you need to get the API-Key's from [worldtradingdata.com](www.worldtradingdata.com). Each API request is authenticated with your own personal API token which you can obtain for free by signing up. Currently you can make 250 free api request per day with their free scheme.

Then create a .env file at the project root and assign the API-key to the relevant variable like below. (The key you are seeing below is NOT an actual one, its just for example)

`REACT_APP_WORLD_TRADING_DATA_API_TOKEN=CO9qj6546546arefvref144565ethbdszgffd`

Then just run `npm install` and then `npm start`

A stock-analytics dashboard with React, Highcharts, @vx (charting lib) and usinng finnancial analytics API data from - [www.worldtradingdata.com](www.worldtradingdata.com), api.iextrading.com and financialmodelingprep.com

#### Some notes on using [www.quandl.com/api](www.quandl.com/api) - I ultimately did not use Quandl as its free API gives old data

#### The main disadvantage, of Quandl Free API is that most stocks the "newest_available_date" is "2018-03-27"

```
this is expected behavior as Quandl stopped updating their WIKI pricing dataset,

1> The main official doc is at -

[https://docs.quandl.com/docs/in-depth-usage](https://docs.quandl.com/docs/in-depth-usage)

– Under API > TIME-SERIES > USAGE

2> Lets say, from the big-full-fledged data, which has the following parameters for ‘column_names”

"column_names": ["Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", "Ex-Dividend", "Split Ratio", "Adj. Open", "Adj. High", "Adj. Low", "Adj. Close", "Adj. Volume"],

I only want the field for ‘Close’

The above page ( [https://docs.quandl.com/docs/in-depth-usage](https://docs.quandl.com/docs/in-depth-usage)) says -
“You can slice, transform and otherwise customize your time-series dataset prior to download by appending various optional parameters to your query.”

And now when I click on the hyperlink - ‘parameters’ it takes me to -

[https://docs.quandl.com/docs/parameters-2](https://docs.quandl.com/docs/parameters-2)

Here, I have

column_index - Request a specific column. Column 0 is the date column and is always returned. Data begins at column 1.

This column_index is the parameter that I have to fileter by for filitering ‘column_names’ array in the response data.

So my final query becomes -

[https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/FB.json?&column_index=4&api_key=xVgPxg_akYvyDdHhqEox](https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/FB.json?&column_index=4&api_key=Your-API-KEY)

And I get a ‘data’ field in the response as below

"data": [
["2018-03-27", 152.19],
["2018-03-26", 160.06],
...
...
]
